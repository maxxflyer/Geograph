RESOLVER

Our standard resolver have more functions.
It can delegate/allow external people/contracts to control a plot (controllers).

1)reselling the plot (need owner's final permission)
2)renting the plot
3)setting post cost
4)open/close the plot (open=free post, close=need permission)
3)setting layer cost
4)open/close the plot layering (open=free layering, close=need permission)
5)delete post/layer
6)enter/exit group/state
7)create state
8)create group
9)add/remove permission to moderator/group/controller
10)create post/layer
11)send/accept partnership
12)invite/remove person/dao/AI in the community

GROUPS
Groups can obtain control over a plot. Groups can be private or DAOS or made by other groups.
A private group is a contract controlled by a guy and a serie of moderators/groups/controllers.
A group can be part of many groups at the same time

STATES
A state is something more important, states can only be DAOS.
The phylosohy informing this decision is meant to avoid the raise of centralized powers (they can be anyway effective using groups).
Once you accept to belong to a state, you give implicit control over your plot.
You can exit a state at anytime.

CONTROLLERS
As a matter of fact Groups and States belong to the family of controllers.
A controller can be a wallet, group, state, or any kind of contract.
Once the controller obtains control it can do virtually anything.

LAYERS
There is a list of standard layers
Such standard layers Names are loaded automatically by the interface
No plot can hide the standard layers.
New standard layers should be added later, this may need all plot owners to vote globally.

1)text
2)links
3)video
4)image
3)feed
4)dapps
5)3d objects
6)alerts
7)commercial

MARKET
The system offers a basic resolver.
Further resolvers following our standard could be created and monetized.
Contracts for groups and states can be found in the market.
The market offers the tools to resell/barter plots/layers too.
The market offers the contract for sub-plotting your plot and resell/rent-out your plots.
The sub-plot conytract is a clone of the resolver, with all permissions/skills of the resolver.
This way it is possible to split annd sub-split indefinitely your plot.
The market offers exptensions like wordpress.
You can buy sell subdomains

EARTH CORE AND SPACE
The planet core is not accessible, non the less it can be squatted and visited via pure virtual reality.
Same for outer space.

SOLAR SYSTEM
We create a ledger starting from geodesy.earth
We can later add geodesy.moon, gedesy.mars etc. etc.

EXTENSIONS
Plots/groups/states can have extensions
An extension allows to add basic dapps associated to the plot/groups/state and to make them visible on the interface.
An example is a wallpaper
Extensions are usually bought with money on the market.
The market is visible directly from the interface, you search and pay/install the extension (when you add an extension you just add a link passing the id of the plot/group/state to the extension once opened), the new extension appears as a button for quck opening directly from the interface/map.

VISIBILITY LIST AND SEARCH
You can buy a subdomain from us and become visible in a list/search. Your subdomain redirects to your plot coordinates.
We should have state.geodesy and allow statename.state.geodesy and we should keep track of all states.
Same for group.geodesy and groupname.group.geodesy
