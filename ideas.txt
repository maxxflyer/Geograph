GROUPS
Groups can obtain control over a plot. Groups can be private or DAOS or made by other groups.
A private group is a contract controlled by a guy and a serie of moderators/groups/controllers.
A group can be part of many groups at the same time

STATES
A state is something more important, states can only be DAOS.
The phylosohy informing this decision is meant to avoid the raise of centralized powers (they can be anyway effective using groups).
Once you accept to belong to a state, you give implicit control over your plot.
You can exit a state at anytime.

CONTROLLERS
As a matter of fact Groups and States belong to the family of controllers.
A controller can be a wallet, group, state, or any kind of contract.
Once the controller obtains control it can do virtually anything.
